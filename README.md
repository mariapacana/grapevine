grapevine
=========

Grapevine is a game where you take turns writing sentences and illustrating them, like Telestrations or Telephone Pictionary. It was made using Javascript, the HTML canvas element, and a Ruby CGI server (no Rails). In the course of making it, I learned about database queries and transactions in SQLite3, JSON, git, ERB email and HTML templating, programming style and web security, and much more.

Short to-do list (as of 1/27/13):
- Display a more visible 'game submitted' message and a 'loading' message
- Build out the drawing features of the canvas (different pen colors/widths)
- Finish cron.rb, which is a cron job that will clear out old games

This game could not have been created without the mentorship of Daniel Erat.
